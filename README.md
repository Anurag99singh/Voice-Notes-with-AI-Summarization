# 🎙️ Voice Notes with AI Summarization (MERN + GenAI)

## 📌 Project Overview

Voice Notes Manager is a full-stack MERN application integrated with GenAI APIs (OpenAI) that allows users to:

- Record and save voice notes.
- Automatically transcribe audio to text.
- Edit and delete notes.
- Generate AI-powered summaries for notes.
- Persist notes in MongoDB for future access.

This project demonstrates **CRUD operations in MERN**, **AI API integration**, and **state management in React** with a clean UI.
